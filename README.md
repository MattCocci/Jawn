Jawn
====

For opening any jawn you want from the command line.


Basic Idea
-----------

Open a file with any extension---that is, open any jawn---simply
with

    j file.ext

Like a file launcher, just tell jawn what file you want to open,
and it will open with the correct program (which you specify
in a .jawn file). 
    - No more 'vim file1.pdf' or evince 'file2.tex.' Just
